Goal - Enable ssl connectivity in bosr.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steps:

1). created a custom resourse using open-cert manager which creates the cert suits as a secret
	and then volume mounted to be used in the bosr server.

2). bosr pod does not allow direct traffic from external host 
	so create a new route with passthorugh option.

This is done on net6. 

3). Lets do connection between bosr and databases. 

once the testing is done for this also then we can go and do this .

1). make a PR with all the changes on bosr and push it , new route , custom resource yaml files.

2). Then deploy the changes to muc-9 and muc-12

3). Then create a expiration alert to restart the bosr pod.

Logs:

Date - 12/02/2024.

----> working on enabling the ssl between bosr server and databases.
	1).  reading documentation of couchbase (https://docs.couchbase.com/go-sdk/current/howtos/managing-connections.html) , 
		mongodb ssl (https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/configure-ssl-clients/)
	
	2). checking the bosr code on how the reqeusts are applied on couchbase (go-sdk is used here) and mongo (mongosh client is used) side. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date - 13/04/2024
		
-----> started reading the application code and saw how the connection request flows from server to couchbase
	1). will see how the  connection string is generated and check what is the root ca used in couchbase cluster and check if we have to give this root ca to gocb client or mongosh client.
	2). check if the root ca is same as amadeus root ca??


	remark- could not do this , felt very lazy as i woke up early and went to office , need to change this strategy of waking up.  Also , some meetings disturbed the flow of working .

-----> Did not do much just had a discussion , wasted a lot of time, slept late yesterday. Then woke up late. Could not focus the whole day and just wasted time. Already wasted 3 days , from now on irrespective of time we don't overlap learning with work time. The after lunch is fully dedicated to work and work only no matter what . Nothing should be done at this point of time.

---------> Read the documentation and  made some progress.

		1). figured how to implement, add the option to include sslVerify option in the deployment.Also looked into factory design pattern.
		up next:
		-----> 1). Should read about factory design pattern more in depth
		-----> 2). do some testing to see the kind of values to use.

------------> 1). understood factory pattern clearly and how its implemented in bosr.

		up next:
		1). do some debugging in bosr with couchbase and mongo examples and see how the 
			connection strings are generated . based on that see the modifications.
		2). finally upload all the changes and make a pr.
		3). Then deploy bosr in muc-9 and muc-12 .

-----------> 1). could not do much work just discussed with akhilesh on mdw sheriffing and also
		BOSR.
		UP NEXT:
			1). should update the sslVerify option in bosr for both the ping , apply 
				and other funciton.
			2). then make a pr with all the changes and then deploy with some print 
				statements with some test cases.
			3). discussing with qying on connecting to servers on azure.
			4). then finally deploy this will be done later on.
			5). Also add documentation on what you understand in bosr, with microdetails
				on how factory method is used and the flow .
